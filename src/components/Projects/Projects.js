              description="
                  An encoder-only transformer is integrated into an open-quantum 
                  system qubit simulator. The model learns to map white noise to 
                  noise present on a quantum computer, where model output is 
                  combined with control pulses to compute observable 
                  expectations. This transformer-based qubit simulator can model 
                  ground truth expectations with 99.97% accuracy. Control pulses
                  are then optimised by back-propagating through the trained
                  transformer noise model. The control pulses achieve 99.89%
                  process fidelity in a noisy environment.

              description="
                  This work shows that the quantum noise operators may be 
                  directly, accurately, and efficiently inferred using a 
                  regression-based approach compared to more expensive deep
                  learning approaches. This noise operator description admits an 
                  efficient parameterisation; this parametrisation is referred
                  to as the quantum feature space arising from an arbitrary 
                  bath coupled to a qubit. This quantum feature space is shown 
                  to be effective at classifying and characterising the noise
                  processes describing qubit-bath interactions.

              description="
                  My honours thesis extended a mathematical model of 
                  qubit-environment interactions and developed a method to 
                  deduce these interactions from experimental data. In this 
                  work, deep learning architectures that map control pulses to 
                  qubit-environment interactions were investigated. 
                  Gradient-free optimisers were used to optimise control pulses 
                  that achieve over 99% process fidelity in noisy environments.

              description="
                Quantum computer circuit error parameters were inferred using 
                PSO to optimise a circuit error model. The MSE between the 
                model's simulated data and experimental data was reduced by a 
                magnitude of ten. The PSO algorithm was used to mitigate the 
                effects of circuit errors. The PSO-optimised control parameters 
                reduced the MSE between measured noisy data and ideal data by 
                62%.

              description="
                RL was used to optimise agent actions in a collective perception 
                problem. When performing opinion fusion, decentralised resilience 
                was implemented by having agents dynamically weight received 
                opinions. An updated collective perception simulation was 
                developed in Python for this research.
