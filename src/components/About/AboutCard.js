            I am Chris Wise from Canberra, Australia. I currently serve as a
            Royal Australian Air Force Officer. I have a Bachelor of Computing
            and Cyber Security (Honours) degree from the University of New South
            Wales. I am interested in reading and learning about AI,
            mathematics, computer science, and quantum physics. For my honours
            thesis, I investigated the application of machine learning to
            quantum computing. I am deeply fascinated by AI and want to use AI
            to accelerate science. My long-term goal is to work for start-up,
            using AI for fusion, renewable energy, or longevity research.
